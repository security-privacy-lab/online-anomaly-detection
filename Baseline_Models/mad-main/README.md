# Repository for the paper, MAD: Multi-Scale Anomaly Detection in Link Streams. 

The repository contains the methods to inject anomalies into the datasets, the implementation of the MAD algorithm and the code to reproduce the experimental results

The repository is structured as follows

* The Data folder contains the anomaly injection procedures.
* The Proposed folder contains MAD and its experimental evaluation. 

To re-run the experiments, go to the Proposed folder and run, pick one type of anomaly (edge, node, graph) and run ./run\_exp.sh
